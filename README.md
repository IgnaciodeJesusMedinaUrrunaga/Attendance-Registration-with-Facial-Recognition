The following repository contains 2 folders Attendance_Registration_CIA & Registro_Asistencia_CIA, the first one is the project in English (explained) and the other one is the project in Spanish (explained).
Of the two folders you only need to use one, I recommend deleting the one that is not explained in your language.

To use this repository the Requirements are:

- Have MYSQL installed and then create a database in it
- Have pip installed and in the path
